Challenge-2

My Portfolio Page

***

The challenge for this week was to build a portfolio page from scratch using HTML and CSS. There was no acceptance criteria for styling wihtin CSS. However, there was an acceptence criteria regarding the functionality of the portfolio page.

***

In my header, My name is displayed in the middle left. 

I put working links on the right side that navigates to the corresponding section of the page.

I have a section containing an About Me.

Due to a lack of experience in the field I could not place links to my work. I put placeholders named HTML, CSS, and JavaScript until I can replace it with future projects. 

I have working links within my Contact Me section that takes the user to the corresponding site. 

I added a reset css file to allow more accessibility with different browsers.
